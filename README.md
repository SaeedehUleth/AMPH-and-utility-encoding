Data of 1 sample session is provided in folder 'Data'. D0 indicates pre-injection and D1 indicates post-injection. This data is already pre-processed, meaning that the cells are spike sorted and behavioural data such as animal location are extracted. The Data folder also includes a structure file of some information about the recorded sessions and rats.
1 script for behavioural analysis and 2 scrpits for neural analysis, as some examples, are provided in the folder 'Codes'. Necessary functions are stored in the folder 'Lib'.
